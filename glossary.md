#####Branch
- an identical copy of a project at a particular point in time kept separate from the 'master' branch (primary copy). This keeps your code in the 'master' branch safe while you make changes and experiment with code on the new branch.  You can **merge** your new branch back into the 'master' branch when you want to publish your changes.

#####Clone
- a copy of an online repository on your local computer so you can make edits on your own personal copy without having to be online. You can sync changes between your clone and the **remote** copy by **pushing** when you are online.

#####Commit
- equivalent to saving your changes to a file.  When you **commit** you usually include a brief description of the changes you made so you can identify versions later if you want to undo a change.

#####Fetch
- 

#####Fork
- making a copy of *someone else's* repository into your own account.

#####Repository
- A repository is the most basic element of GitHub and can be thought of as a project's folder. However, unlike an ordinary folder on your laptop, a GitHub repository offers tools for collaborating with others. A repository contains all of the project files and stores the history of each file.
