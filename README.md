####What is "open" research?
Whether you're studying the human genome, black holes, deep sea ecology, medieval music,  or alternative energy sources, research is a practice and process of learning, and creating knowledge. Researchers always build on (or transform) an existing understanding of the world. **A researcher working open shares insights or discoveries freely, makes her data available on the web, or makes the details of a new experimental technique or tool public so others can use and reuse it. By working open, she empowers fellow researchers and furthers our collective knowledge... knowledge that can be used to solve problems, save lives, and inspire and amaze us all.** The more data, knowledge, methods, tools and skills made widely and openly available to all, the better.  

####Oh, by the way, what's Mozilla Science Lab??
At [Mozilla Science Lab](https://mozillascience.org/) we help scientists and researchers (anyone from students to established researchers to citizen scientists) to work openly and do better research, more research, and make that research more useful by sharing it widely.  

We provide various types of trainings (such as this Workshop), learning materials and formats (such as [Mozilla Study Groups](http://mozillascience.github.io/studyGroupHandbook/)), platforms for sharing and showcasing open Science projects (such as [MSL Collaborate](https://mozillascience.org/collaborate)), and support for leaders in open science (through the [Mozilla Fellows for Science](https://mozillascience.org/fellows).
