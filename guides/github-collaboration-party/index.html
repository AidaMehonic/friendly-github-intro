        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based interface for version control, a way of keeping track of changes made to a collection of working documents. GitHub provides a structure and space for communicating about collaborative work on open projects. <strong> With bit of set-up, and a good workflow, you can make your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators.</strong></p>
        <p>This exercise walks you through a collaborative workflow for using Git/Github through the GitHub web interface. </p>
        <h3>The Brief</h3>
        <p>You notice online someone is planning a party, but clearly lack any direction for how to make this party <em>off the hook</em>. Because you want this party to be <em>da bomb</em> you decide you're going to contribute some help based on the issues that this person has posted in their repo. </p>
        <p>You know that since you don't know this person, you'll have to <b>comment on the issue of interest to let them know what you're working on</b>, <b>fork their repo</b>, make changes and commit them to your fork, and then make a pull request to show the party planner your contributions. </p>
