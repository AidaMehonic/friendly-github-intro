**11:00 - 12:00: Set Up You First Project**

* You will have an hour to set up your first GitHub Project. To get a feeling for the workflow shown in the prior presentations, try to:
	* Create a repo from scratch
	* Make a README documenting what your project is about, who is involved, why it is interesting, how to get the project setup (e.g. what version of R, what packages are you using, links to references, etc.) 
	* Create some issues that need to be completed - add labels to them.
	* Create a few commits
	* Create a branch to experiment new features on:
		* make a pull request to merge those changes into your "master" branch
	* Revert a commit
	* Celebrate! 

**12:00 - 12:30: Lunch**

* Pizza and drinks will be served (there will be some veg/gluten free options in case there are food allergies).
